Take automatic screenshots of your web pages and do your own visual regression tests using Node, Jest and Puppeteer headless browser

## Introduction
This is the basic first version of the project. For the moment, it should be considered as a quick demo and a proof of concept. I'll work on proper documenting what is already there and improvement the code as soon as I have a bit of time.

Meanwhile, you can watch this demo and explanation video
